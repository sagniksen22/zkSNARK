# README: Implementing and Verifying a Circuit with circom and Solidity

## Overview

This README provides a step-by-step guide to implement a circuit using circom, compile it, generate a proof, deploy a verifier contract to a testnet (Sepolia or Mumbai), and verify the proof using the deployed contract.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- circom (tool for creating circuits that can be compiled to zk-SNARKs)
- snarkjs (toolkit for zk-SNARKs: keypair generation, proof generation, and verification)
- Solidity compiler (for compiling Solidity contracts)
- A web3 provider (like Infura or Alchemy) to interact with Ethereum testnets

### Steps

#### 1. Define the Circuit

Create a file `circuit.circom` with your circuit definition.

#### 2. Compile the Circuit

Compile your circuit to generate intermediate files.

#### 3. Generate Proofs

Prepare an input file `input.json` with the values for A and B. Generate the witness and the proof.

#### 4. Deploy Verifier Contract

Deploy a Solidity verifier contract to a testnet (Sepolia or Mumbai).

#### 5. Verify the Proof

Call the `verifyProof()` method on the deployed verifier contract and assert the output is true.

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Define the Circuit

Create a file named `circuit.circom` that contains your circuit definition. This file will specify the logic of the circuit and the inputs/outputs it will handle.

#### 2. Compile the Circuit

Use circom to compile your circuit definition into an intermediate representation. This will generate several files, including `.r1cs`, `.wasm`, and `.sym` files.

#### 3. Generate Proofs

1. **Prepare Input File**: Create an `input.json` file with the inputs for your circuit (e.g., `{"A": "0", "B": "1"}`).
2. **Calculate Witness**: Generate the witness file using snarkjs.
3. **Generate Proof**: Use snarkjs to generate the proof and the public signals.

#### 4. Deploy Verifier Contract

1. **Write Solidity Contract**: Create a Solidity contract that will verify the proof.
2. **Compile Contract**: Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler.
3. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the compiled contract to a testnet (Sepolia or Mumbai) using a web3 provider like Infura or Alchemy.

#### 5. Verify the Proof

1. **Interact with Contract**: Use a script or a web3 interface to call the `verifyProof()` method on the deployed contract.
2. **Assert Output**: Ensure the output of the `verifyProof()` method is true, indicating the proof is valid.

### Additional Information

For more details on using circom and snarkjs, refer to their official documentation:

- [circom documentation](https://docs.circom.io/)
- [snarkjs documentation](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)

For deploying contracts to Ethereum testnets, consider using tools like Truffle, Hardhat, or Remix.

By following these steps, you can implement, compile, generate proofs, deploy a verifier contract, and verify proofs on an Ethereum testnet.
